# Preemptive CPU Scheduler
> Creation Date: June, 2020
## Description
During a computer system’s day-to-day operations, it makes use of various data, files, and information which are used to perform or execute various processes. In order to perform the aforementioned operations more quickly, the CPU must make use of one of several different scheduling algorithms, thus allowing efficient use of the CPU’s available resources. A Preemptive CPU Scheduler is a program which seeks to identify, evaluate and ultimately organize the execution of processes are necessary for the computer’s overall operational efficiency.
